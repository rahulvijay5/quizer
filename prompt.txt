I am going to provide you some of the questions and answer, and you need to arrange each one of them into a json array,
whoose format follows this:
[
{
    "Question": "Question",
    "opt1": "Option 1",
    "opt2": "Option 2",
    "opt3": "Option 3",
    "opt4": "Option 4",
    "opt5": "Option 5",
    "correctAns": "Correct Answer",
    "resource": "",
    "proposedAns": ""
},
{
    "Question": "Question",
    "opt1": "Option 1",
    "opt2": "Option 2",
    "opt3": "Option 3",
    "opt4": "Option 4",
    "opt5": "Option 5",
    "correctAns": "Correct Answer",
    "resource": "",
    "proposedAns": ""
},
...
]

for now keep, proposedAns as empty string, for that question in correctAns add all of that options which are correct, add their values in correctAns array.
